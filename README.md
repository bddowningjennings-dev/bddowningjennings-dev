### I'm Blane, howdy ðŸ‘‹
##### Pronouns: He/Him
#### [bddowningjennings.dev](bddowningjennings.dev) << dumb site about me (but briefly about Joe Pesci)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a mathematician, an automator, software engineer, developer, analyst, programmer... âœ¨ ***shrug***âœ¨  I don't even know, I guess. But I've had jobs with these & other titles - those don't seem too important to me... Really, I value helping others and am trying to find the path that makes my life better through service to others and I'm constantly trying harder/getting better at making things because right now that's my path to rise up.
